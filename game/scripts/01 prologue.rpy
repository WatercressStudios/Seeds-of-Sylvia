    anr "Apples. Onions. Potatoes. Pumpkins. These are just a tiny fraction of the crops we have cultivated by the grace of honeybees. In the recent past, one in three meals eaten by humans existed through the pollination of bees—but this year, reports indicate that this number may have fallen to one in thirty."

    anr "Those of us here at WCPR have been reporting for years on the steady and haunting decline of bees. Myriad efforts to halt or even slow the mysterious tide of Colony Collapse Disorder have failed, and today the crisis seems more dire than ever. Honeybee populations have been completely extirpated across ninety-eight percent of North America, and the statistics are similar across all continents. In the absence of pollinators, several species of plants have already gone extinct."
     
    nvl clear

    anr "On Wednesday President Farsakh announced the formation of a task force, complete with a multi-billion dollar initiative backed by Congress, to back research supporting the revival of honeybee populations across all of North America and, eventually, the globe. Next week the president will be travelling to a U.N. conference to urge cooperation from all world leaders."

    anr "However, an expert in insect populations, agricultural science, and epidemiology has been issuing the disturbing warning that these well-intentioned efforts are already too late. Dr. Zunduin Mördorj, Professor of Agriculture at the Central Ridgewood Institute of Technology, has been issuing a disturbing warning—that, in his words, ‘the age of the honeybee has already ended.’"

    nvl clear
     
    anr "This morning, we have him here in the studio to tell us more about this issue. Dr. Mördorj, it’s great to have you."
     
    dor "Thanks, Takara. It’s a pleasure to be here."
     
    anr "So, you’ve been arguing that efforts to save the bees are futile, and possibly even counterproductive. Why is that?"

    nvl clear

    dor "Well, we’ve wasted much too much time already—the term ‘Colony Collapse Disorder’ was coined in 2006, and in twenty years of research there’s still no scientific consensus on what even causes it, much less how to counteract it. Parasites, toxic fungi, viruses, nicotinoids, climate change—these have all been hugely destructive to the species, but still only fragments of the puzzle. At the rate bees are disappearing, we have only about a year to eighteen months to resolve the problem."
     
    nvl clear

    dor "We’ve had the best scientific minds working on this problem for three decades. Even with additional funding, it seems unlikely we’ll figure out how to save the bees while there are still bees to save."
     
    anr "But while there are still living bees on the planet, why would it be bad to try?"
     
    dor "There are indeed still living bees, certainly, but the sad reality is that we don’t even know where most of them are. Most of the remaining one percent of living honeybees is missing. They’re lost somewhere in the wilderness, if they even exist at all. And while we’re wasting time, manpower and resources trying to find them, human beings are starving."

    nvl clear
     
    anr "You’ve been saying that we should just ignore the problem? Pull the funding and let the bees go extinct?"
     
    dor "Heavens, no. I absolutely believe an effort of this scale is necessary—but we’re visualizing the problem the wrong way. This is a lost cause; too much damage has already been done. The loss of the honeybees is disturbing and sad, and probably could have been avoided, but it’s far too late—and unfortunately our decision-makers in government and most of the leading scientific experts are looking at the situation with a sort of myopia."
     
    nvl clear

    dor "I will give you the straight truth, Takara. The bees are lost—but that doesn’t mean our food supply is, too. We need to be leveraging our remaining resources to explore alternate means of crop pollination."
     
    anr "There are ways to pollinate crops without honeybees?"
     
    dor "Not yet, but with modern technology, there can be. In a sense, you can say we need to build a better bee."
     
    nvl clear

    anr "Now, you’ve written a book, Mourning the Past: New Visions for Humanity, and in it, you propose a solution that’s rather surprising. Could you speak on that?"
     
    dor "Absolutely. The solution is modern technology, Takara. We need to build a better bee. Tiny robotic nanodrones—in the books I call them synthbees, but in truth they probably won’t look anything like honeybees—with complete immunity to pesticides, viruses or parasites, will pollinate our crops. Nobody will have to starve."
     
    nvl clear

    anr "But in the modern day, is it even possible to create these ‘synthbees’?"
     
    dor "Emphatically yes. In fact, that’s what we’ve been working on at the CRIT—prototypes for these pollen delivery systems. It’s a project being worked on by some of our best and brightest minds—including many experts on artificial intelligence. As soon as a design for the synthbees is perfected, building sufficiently massive swarms will just be a matter of working closely with the manufacturing sector."
     
    nvl clear

    dor "Adapting existing infrastructure to create these factories, we may even be able to revive the economies of the many struggling cities in the Rust Belt. Jobs will move from the agricultural sector to the industrial sector."
     
    anr "And in your book, you argue that this is the first step in new technological revolution—that these manufacturing plants could eventually produce even smaller, more advanced technology."
     
    dor "Indeed. Just as synthbees will perform the job of honeybees at two hundred times the efficiency, we’ll be able to use the same technological principles to multiply efficiency elsewhere in our lives. We could manufacture trillions of respirocytes, for example—synthetic blood cells. A human being whose natural blood cells were replaced with respirocytes could hold their breath underwater for several hours once the natural reflexes are suppressed."
     
    nvl clear

    anr "So, ultimately, you’re arguing that the disappearance of the bees will be beneficial to civilization?"
     
    dor "I think so, Takara. Progress is always forged strongest in the crucible of adversity. If it takes the extinction of a species to usher in a new era of technological advancement, then I, for one, welcome the end of the bees."

    anr "An interesting view, to be sure. We thank you again for your time, Dr. Mördorj. That book again is—"
