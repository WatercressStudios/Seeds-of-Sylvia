    "Something’s just not right this morning."

    "There’s... I can’t even place it. Quiet. Absolute quiet. It’s like a disused classroom in the middle of a locked building."

    "What could even have happened while I was sleeping?"

    "I should be making breakfast, but my stomach’s all twisted in a knot from this anxious feeling. It’s the first time I’ve felt this way, in this perfect, practically sacred clearing. It’s... it’s as though..."

    "Like the corruption that’s swallowing the rest of this forest is starting to make its way to the heart. To Sylvia."

    "Emerging from my bedroll, I crawl out of the tent and survey the surroundings. The blue flowers look as healthy as ever, but today they stand perfectly still. There’s no breeze to gently sway them back and forth."

    "And then my heart starts racing, as it suddenly occurs to me: the bees aren’t out today."

    "Sylvia implied her \"time\" was limited, whatever that meant, but... I never took it seriously. No—I never wanted to believe it. I didn’t want to accept that this grove—this frozen moment in time, this last gasp of Gaea’s former radiance—was ephemeral. But..."

    "...If the bees aren’t out..."

    "Then where could they have possibly gone?"

    "The turnip flower appears as healthy as ever, but as much as I’d like to heave a sigh of relief, I know that something’s wrong. Something that Sylvia never prepared me for during any of our discussions."

    "I kneel into the dirt, inspecting the plant so closely the petals almost tickle my nose, but try as I might I can’t locate any visual evidence this turnip isn’t as healthy as ever—and though Sibyl may denigrate my contributions to science, I have the same background in botany she does."

    ash "We’re good, right?"

    "Predictably (however disappointingly,) she doesn’t respond, but I’m calling it: Sylvia’s fine. Whatever’s disturbing this forest, it’s not any damage from the inside..."

    "...Wait."

    "Sibyl." 

    "Damn it! How could I have forgotten?"

    "Two days, and you can call it in, I’d said. She was as good as her word, but... our last conversation did nothing to persuade her to give me any more time. She probably kept her promise to the second, and then immediately told Professor Mördorj."

    "This is it, then. She brought in the cavalry. Hell, the entire department might be showing up, stomping all over the forest and disrupting the emotional resonance of this place."

    "Oh, goddess. They’re going to kill her. They’re going to kill everything. And I don’t know how I’m going to stop them..."

    ash "No, Sibyl! You can’t do this! You can’t—"

    "Then a different voice comes in through the static. A older man’s voice, one I recognize immediately."

    ash "No! Don’t listen to her! You—"

    mor "A discovery of wild honeybees? In our own backyard? And you elected to hide this from the Institute, and from me, potentially jeopardizing any scientific knowledge that could be gained here? You’re unwell, Ashley. Allow us to get you the help you need. We’re going to collect the specimen whether you like it or not."

    "Oh, no. No no no no no."

    "This is really happening. They’re coming here. They’re going to kill Sylvia. To kill this forest."

    "...And I’m going to be powerless to stop them."

    "I feel so helpless I could scream, but even that would just lead the Professor to my position faster. I can’t even do that..."

    "I can talk, though."

    "Talk to Sylvia. Tell her what’s happening. Maybe she won’t respond—maybe she already knows—but it’ll clear my head, at least."

    ash "Sylvia, I don’t know what to do."

    ash "The Professor is on his way here—escorted by who knows how many cronies—and when he gets here, they’re going to tear this forest apart in the name of scientific investigation. They’re going to kill you, if I don’t stop them. They’re going to kill the bees. They... He means well, but I think he’s going to destroy everything."

    ash "He won’t let me stand in his way. He’s trying to turn people to his way of thinking—to make a statement, prove that humanity’s salvation lies only in completely subduing nature. And... You’re inconvenient to him, Sylvia."

    ash "Any evidence that Nature isn’t terminal—that it can still be saved without humans getting hurt—is harmful to his case. To his dreams. And they’re all he has. If he has to go through me to get to you, he will."

    ash "But... I’m all there is to get through. We... I didn’t have enough time to convince Sibyl to see the truth of things. She means well, but maybe it was an impossible task. She still thinks the Professor’s right."

    "I pause, perhaps in a vain hope that I’ll hear her voice, her soothing words, but there’s just a deafening silence."

    ash "I... look, I’m not a violent person, I don’t think."

    "My voice trembles as I say these words to her."

    ash "I don’t want to hurt anyone. But... they’re willing to go through me to get to you. And... I could never let that happen. I could never live with myself."

    ash "So..."

    ash "I don’t understand everything about this. We haven’t talked enough... I act like I know everything that’s going on, but I... I don’t. At the end of the day, I only have my intuition."

    ash "The Professor thinks I’m completely insane—he wants to have me committed, put in a box somewhere and medicated so thoroughly I’ll become as numb as he is to the dying of the world. And the sad thing, the thing I’m ashamed to admit is... Sometimes I wonder if I am delusional."

    ash "So... long story short, I don’t feel great about the fact that I’m going to use lethal force to protect you, if necessary. But I’m not a fighter, so... if I do this, things don’t look good for either of us."

    ash "But we’re out of options—I’m only one person. And I’m not ready to live in a dying world that willfully destroyed its last best hope. So... I guess this is how it ends."

    "Still nothing. The turnip flower twirls a bit in the breeze."

    ash "Goddess, this is going to be the stupidest thing I’ve ever done."

    nar "I leave the turnip where she is, rooting through my knapsack for duct tape and my all-purpose knife. Snapping off the forked end of the rake I brought along using the heel of my boot and a particularly jagged rock, I secure the knife to the shaft, blade facing outward, and use the rest of the tape to create what I hope is a serviceable grip."

    nar "A spear. I’ve made a spear. I’m going to defend Sylvia using a spear I made out of crap I happened to have lying around. No, it's not a spear, it's a thorn. A thorn on an oaken staff. Oak, Ash, and Thorn. I laugh like I've lost my marbles."

    nar "History’s going to make me look like a maniac, isn’t it? Well, what little history this world has left, anyway."

    nar "Maybe people like me—people who see the world this way—aren’t meant to exist in these fading times. There’s never been a day in my life I haven’t felt like an anachronism, like my entire worldview was some horrible atavism not meant to survive the modern world."

    nar "If I’d been born back in the days where people actually used spears—out in the woods, in the real, thriving woods of the hunter-gatherers, making medicine in a mortar, carving Ogham into some found piece of deadwood... Maybe then the world would make more sense to me."

    nar "The Professor and whoever he’s brought along with him will be within eyeshot of the clearing in under a minute, now. I wrack my brain for anything I’ve missed—some brilliant plan I can execute in under thirty seconds—but this isn’t the kind of scenario I’ve ever had to prepare for..."

    nar "It’s amazing how your life can turn completely upside-down in under three days."

    nar "With the flower to my back, I do my best to point my spear menacingly in the general direction of where I expect the Professor to emerge. Of course, I have no way of actually knowing where he actually will—and this clearing laid out the way it is, I’m put in the unenviable position of having to guard the turnip three hundred sixty degrees."

    sib "Ashley."

    "I spin to the left. Sibyl walks casually out from the trees, but when she sees what I’m holding she stops in her tracks and goes pale."

    sib "Ashley...? You—you can’t seriously—"

    ash "I don’t want to, Sibyl. So don’t make me."

    "Her eyes quiver in horror as they meet my own, and pangs of guilt run through me. I never wanted Sibyl to think the things about me she’s undoubtedly thinking."

    sib "You’ve lost your mind, Applegate. It’s just a fucking flower. You’re really gonna stab me if I try to collect it?"

    sib "What corner? We agreed you’d get two days to—"

    mor "Hello, Dr. Applegate."

    "The Professor’s voice rings out from behind me. He’s entered the clearing from the opposite end of the grove, flanked by what appear to be forest rangers and his own rent-a-cops."

    "This is officially a siege."

    ash "...Professor."

    "He looks at me with all the disdain of a businessman on Wall Street stepping over a homeless woman."

    mor "A stick, really? You’re completely unhinged."

    ash "I’m just trying to do what’s best, Professor. I told you that when you hired me on."

    "He laughs derisively, a coarse, metallic sound, like a saw going through wood."

    mor "My dear, I hired you on because your mother was an old... colleague of mine. Your doctorate thesis was complete nonsense. Snake oil. Quackery of the highest order."

    mor "But I felt that if I just sequestered you away with Dr. Colwell, publishing monotonous reports on the  pH of soil samples  and measuring erosion, your senseless worldview would do no harm to the CRIT—or my own scientific reputation."

    sib "...Professor?!"

    "From behind me, Sibyl sounds shocked and upset with the Professor’s wanton acidity."

    mor "Please spare me, Dr. Colwell. This isn’t about your feelings."

    "The Professor speaks past me to address her, as though I was just another meaningless feature of the landscape."

    mor "You’ve acted completely out of line, waiting so long to bring this to my attention—I don’t care what agreements you made with this lunatic. I certainly hope you didn’t expect to be commended for this discovery. Once we’ve taken care of the errant Dr. Applegate, the Board of Directors will most likely ask for  your resignation."

    sib "...But—!"

    mor "Some dignity, please."

    "Professor Mördorj finally meets my eyes again, as if remembering that I’m there."

    mor "Now, Dr. Applegate,  I think you understand you can’t stop me from collecting the specimen. These men and women are here to place you under arrest. You’ve violated quite a number of laws."

    ash "What do you even care? You just want all the bees to die so you can sell your fucking robots anyway, right?"

    mor "The bees are extinct. This area is simply a statistical anomaly. Dr. Colwell and yourself found, what, two bees? What exactly is it you hope to do with them? You don’t even know if there’s a hive, a queen. And even if there was, they’re probably already corrupted."

    ash "Do you even believe what you’re saying? Bees can’t live without a hive."

    mor "The last gasp of a decrepit hive. Bees get infected with parasites. They go astray. They forget where their hives are and die in the wilderness."

    ash "Not all of them and not always. You practically sound upset the bees are alive."

    mor "I’m trying to save the people of this world from starving, Applegate. You’ve done nothing of accomplishment with your life, so I understand that you don’t know the burden of responsibility, but in order for the scientific community to get things done, we need to build a consistent narrative."

    mor "Lawmakers, corporate executives, all the various benefactors from whom scientific funding is granted—these people are obtuse, hiveminded demagogues. They can only be spurred to action when a crisis is too large to overcome. Look how they bend over themselves now, to save a species that’s demonstrably been in jeopardy for the last fifty years. They only act to save the bees when the bees are extinct."

    mor "This discovery—actual honeybees in the wild—it undermines the narrative we are building. The longer it takes humanity to come to terms with the fact that the bees are gone, the longer it takes for us to develop synthetic pollinators. The longer people will starve."

    ash "You’re wrong. You’re fucking clueless. Bees and humans are symbiotic. A macroorganism. If the bees die, we die too. Your stupid machines won’t save us."

    "He sighs, shaking his head in disappointment."

    mor "I don’t know why I bother explaining myself to you. At the end of the day, you’re just a cultist—a spoiled child who places their faith in fairy tales."

    sib "Wait—Professor. Are you saying you’re not actually going to research the turnip? Research what connection it has to the bees?"

    mor"I am not, Doctor Colwell, because I will not place false hope in magical solutions. We have a clear and consistent plan for the future already."

    mor "The specimen will be collected, dissected, and patented—copyrighted, if necessary, to prevent other scientists from studying it. I will not permit this line of investigation to take place."

    sib "But you can’t—!"

    mor "Someday, you’ll understand. Unlike Doctor Applegate, you still have a respectable career ahead of you—just... not at the CRIT."

    "I shake my head, fists clenched in anger." 

    ash "No. I’ll never let you do this. I’ll fight you off if I have to."

    "The Professor shrugs, resting his hands diffidently in the pocket of his labcoat."

    mor "If you’re resolute, I suppose I have no choice."

    mor "My dear, you’re much too young to be afflicted with a heart condition, aren’t you?"

    ash "Huh?"

    "...A taser—!"

    ash "...No—!"

    "As soon as I see the needles glinting in the morning sun, it’s already far too late. Two hot knives bury themselves in my gut—and I collapse to the ground, convulsing wildly as they seem to grow hotter and hotter inside my flesh."

    mor "So much for that... Hold them down, please. I don’t want to get kicked whilst I extract the specimen."

    "I can barely see anything, barely take note of my surroundings... As the electricity rushes through my body, I can see the oozing silhouettes of giants standing above me, feel hands clamping deep into my skin..."

    "Something collides with the person choking me—our snarl of forms tremors, like a car hitting a bumper—and the arm around me loosens enough for me to twist my head to the blue turnip flower. To Sylvia. To the Professor, shoving a spade deep into the soil around her."

    "Something is said offscreen, and the woman nods."

    ann "All across the globe, it seems that honeybees have flooded in from what seems to be nowhere. From Africa to Europe, Asia to the Americas, bee sightings are coming in by the millions. I... I can't believe my eyes. Is it a plague? The scientists tell us it's a blessing in disguise."

    "I down the rest of my drink in a silent toast to she who has made this possible. The taste on my tongue is bitter and sweet, earthy and mellow. Grains, and their essence, in my mouth and in my blood."

    sib "You've... you’ve got to be fucking kidding me."

    "...Thank you, Sylvia. Even if I don’t fully understand how, thank you for giving the bees—giving humanity—this chance to make things right."

    "I’ve never felt more loved than I do now, in this single, perfect moment."

    "I can see the beginning twinkles of tears welling in Sibyl’s eyes, and her lip trembles with emotion."

    sib "I... I never really believed... It seemed so impossible..."

    ash "It’s perfect... A reprieve for humanity. A chance to remake the world—to create something sustainable."

    sib "This can’t—you don’t really think this has something to do with that turnip, do you?"

    ash "She was more than just a turnip, Sibyl. I know you don’t believe me, but... if we’d had more time, you might have seen her."

    "Sibyl makes a sour face, as though unhappy with my answer, but then it slackens, and she buries her face into her elbows."

    sib "I almost wish I could go back to thinking you were crazy. I’m... this isn’t comfortable for me."

    ash "Sibyl..."

    sib "Those bees back there... The ones that swarmed the Professor... They really showed up in the nick of time, didn’t they?"

    sib "And I keep asking myself, why were they so angry? Why didn’t they attack you? Why didn’t they attack me?"

    sib "It was like they were more than just insects. But I didn’t want to believe it."

    ash "And now you do?"

    "She rolls her eyes, barking a sardonic laugh."

    sib "I don’t know what to believe anymore."

    sib "All I have is science. Rules, systems... They’re the only thing that’s ever made sense to me."

    sib "I put all my faith in the Professor. He was kind of my hero, if I’m being honest. He seemed like the perfect, empirical mind, the ultimate scientist—but at the end of the day, he was really more of an engineer, wasn’t he?"

    sib "I mean, when push came to shove, he wasn’t interested in having his hypothesis challenged. He wanted people moved out of his way so he could start rebuilding society in his own image."

    ash "A world without bees... I’m not sure that it would have been viable, but I certainly don’t think it could have been happy."

    "She ignores my interjection."

    sib "At the end of the day... science was less important to him than solutions. And he thought he was the one-stop shop for those."

    sib "Ashley... I don’t want you to think I’ve come around to your way of thinking. Because your way of thinking’s pretty damn strange."

    "I crack a smirk."

    ash "I guess it is."

    sib "But I’m a scientist. And what the Professor did was the cardinal sin of science; he became numb to the truth."

    sib "I never want to do that, Ashley. Ever."

    sib "So I need to admit that I don’t have all the answers. That a whole fuckload of things happened today that I may never fully understand."

    sib "And I’m a scientist out of a job, anyway, so... Maybe the best thing I can do is stick with you. Find the right place for those seeds of yours. Figure out what I believe. Maybe even try and see that woman in the turnip you claim to have seen, or one like her."

    ash "I would like that."

    sib "Besides, you need a friend."

    ash "Huh?"

    sib "When you’re alone, when nobody believes you... You’re not at your best, Ash."

    sib "From now on, I’m really on your side. I’ll follow your lead. You don’t have to point weird spears at me."

    "I laugh nervously."

    ash "Next time, you’ll get your own spear."

    sib "Ummm... Let’s just try to be spear-free in the future, ‘kay?"

    ash "Fine by me."

    sib "So... what happens now?"

    ash "We’ll get some rest. It’s been a hell of a day."

    ash "And, in the morning... We’ll take a look at those seeds. Find a home for each of them, eventually."

    ash "You have any frequent flyer miles? We’ll probably have to spread these pretty far and wide."

    sib "Ugh. Thinking about it’s making me dizzy. Let’s start one day at a time. Pour me another drink, will you?"

    "I laugh, a full-throated, happy sound, and accommodate her request."

    "The truth is... I don’t know what the future holds."

    "A second chance is just that... A second chance. Just as easily as the bees returned, they could leave again. Humanity exists in spite of itself. Try as I might to get people to care, it’s possible we’ll just blow it again."

    "But... these past few days, I felt a presence greater than myself. Something pure, something loving, something rooting for me. For humanity. A goddess, perhaps—or perhaps not, but something that matters."

    "I love this planet. I love the creatures that dwell on it, and I love the dreams that pulse within it. I love seeing the sun, feeling the rain. I want the symphony to go on forever."

    "So all I can do is remember Sylvia—remember her beauty, remember the love she felt for me, remember her vision—and try to carry it out in my words and deeds. Do what I can, with what I have."
