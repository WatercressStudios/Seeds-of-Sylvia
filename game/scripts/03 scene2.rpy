    nar "I raise my head to get a better view of the rolling hills—a picturesque scene; a vista of the beauty of nature. Well, 'beauty' is a slight exaggeration, these days. It’s sort of like if you spilled some paint-thinner on your mother's favourite watercolour painting, dragged it to the bathtub, and scrubbed it all off: a bunch of the colour spirals down the drain, and all you're left with is a grungy brown patina clinging to a frame of laminated wood. It’s kind of drab, is what I’m saying."

    nar "The grassland’s drying up quickly, a swathe of charcoal brown overcoming the landscape a little more every day. The flower patches that previously plastered these fields - irises, hibiscuses, and even some wild roses—are slouching like tired animals, losing their colour and slowly dissolving to mulch. Not particularly easy on the eyes. My mouth flattens as I turn to my small notebook, jotting down a few points."

    sib "Oi, Earth to Ashley, you awake!? We're going to lose the bee!"

    "I blink forcefully, getting my head out of the clouds and meeting the scowl my co-worker is shooting me. The exasperation lighting up her eyes could burn a hole through concrete."

    "I glance past her, assessing our feverish pursuit of the bee had led us to the outskirts of the forest. Scrawny trees dot the borderlands of the prairies and the deeper part of the forest. I try to gauge the distance."

    ash "Awareness of your surroundings is a critical skill to exercise. We don't want to get lost in the woods, or fall victim to something."

    sib "What exactly are you keeping an eye out for?"

    ash "Bears. Quicksand. Particularly pointy tree branches. Mouthy scientists."

    sib "Ugh, there won't be quicksand in- oh, fantastic, we lost it."

    "I look off into the distance again.  True to her word, the bee just fluttered off to God knows where."

    ash "Let's keep a cool head about this. It couldn't have gone far."

    sib "Of course you're the one who wants to keep a cool head about this—you're the one who screwed the pooch to start with!"

    ash "Shoosh! Loud noises attract bears. We ought to just split up and canvas the terrain."

    sib "YOU-"

    ash "It fled into the forest. We already know about the power source of the forest, but it would be better for us to split up and figure out where it's fleeing to."

    sib "..."

    "Sibyl clearly wasn't pleased with this suggestion. I continued."

    ash "Look, I’m driving you crazy anyway, right?"

    sib "Even more than usual, yeah."

    ash "So I’ll give you some space. We'll cover way more ground that way anyway."

    sib "...Fine. You got your walkie-talkie?"

    ash "Of course." 

    "I pull it out without hesitation."

    sib "And it’s charged?"

    "I roll my eyes."

    ash "Yes, mom."

    "She holds up her own walkie-talkie."

    sib "Good. If either of us find the bee, we ring the other up with our coordinates. This place's pretty big and sprawling; I don't want either of us getting lost."

    ash "Perish the thought! A few seconds ago you looked as though you were planning to kill me."

    "She smirks grimly. "

    sib "Only if I can make it look like an accident."

    ash "Nice to know I can trust you on that, at least..." 

    "We holster our talkies, nodding with a clear understanding of what the plan is. It’s refreshing, honestly; when we finally agree on something, it doesn’t take much to get us rolling.  Sibyl was the first to start jogging in."

    sib "Let's go! If we really lost this thing, I'll make sure to kill you when we get back!~"

    "My gut sinks with premonitive dread."

    ash "S-sure, let's go."

    nar "It’s been some ten minutes since Sibyl and I initially split up in our search for the bee. I try to push it to the back of my mind. She'll be fine on her own. I mean, she’s pretty scary—if she actually encountered a bear, she could probably best it in a fight. She’s the sort who keeps the name-brand can of bear mace on her person. As well as an actual mace. Of mithril."

    nar "My pace slows to a gingerly walk. I’m trying to be careful not to tamper with the wildlife and foliage dotting this overgrown, derelict path."

    nar "A falling leaf tickles against my hair, falling supine against the layers of countless other fallen leaves already shrouding the ground. I glance down, observing the myriad warm colours at my feet."

    nar "An anachronistic chill falls over me. This is mid-August, yes? The leaves are falling much earlier than they ever should have been in this part of the world. It’s still summer, but it feels as though I wandered into a Rockefeller painting. It’s... disconcerting."

    nar "And it dawns on me; I haven't seen green foliage for a long time, coming out here. Here it is, though, growing abundantly, everywhere."

    nar "I turn around to take a look at the autumn-esque path I cut through to reach this point. The contrast is staggering, like a border line drawn on a map—no, like maps of two completely different places, overlapping on a desk. Remarkable, though perhaps not terribly surprising."

    nar "There’s a strange feeling in the air. Or, perhaps the fact that there’s any feeling is strange. The rest of the forest felt very, very still compared to this small meadow, which feels... like it’s alive, and flowing. Like a river, rather than a limpid, stagnant pond."

    nar "...And then I see it."

    nar "The bee just landed on one of its petals...!"

    nar "I creep up closer to the flower, kneeling down to get a better look. It’s hard to place a finger on it, but this plant has a... resonance about it. It seems to... flow, and ebb, pulsing like the beat of a human heart."

    nar "I could just stare at it forever, as though looks alone would reveal to me its secrets..."

    nar "A nervous electricity arches through my fingers. I fear if I merely prod it, that energy will dissipate like the popping of a soap bubble. My ears tune in to every sound it makes as its leaves sway to and fro in the gentle breeze. It’s oddly meditative."

    "I violently roll back a sleeve to consult my watch."

    ash "You... are... completely right? Well, that’s odd."

    sib "The only ‘odd’ thing is this forest. It’s like someone drew a line around the damn thing, and caked ammonium nitrate over everything inside it. It’s weird."

    "Shuddering as though caught in a sudden breeze, she regains her earlier chiding tone."

    sib "But that’s not the damn point! Look, I know you’re trying to ditch me, but at least have the damn courtesy to admit it. What did you even find?"

    "I step aside to reveal the flower, turning my attention to it as well, now that whatever bizarre effect it had on me had evidently been dispelled." 

    "If Sibyl hadn’t shown up, how long would I...?"

    "It’s an extraordinary flower, to say the least, and I’ve never laid eyes on anything quite like it. The bee from before disappeared at some point, apparently out from under Sibyl’s nose, though there was still an ambient sort of buzzing, though there aren’t any bees in sight to explain it."

    "There has to be a colony somewhere, unless these bees are lost—common enough in these final days of Colony Collapse, but it would be disappointing, to say the least."

    "Sibyl crouches beside me, her anger temporarily on hold as she examines the flower."

    sib "Is that... a turnip flower?" 

    "She cast about for a minute or two before returning."

    sib "What the hell is a turnip... a blue turnip doing out here? Wait. This thing’s a prairie turnip! A fucking prairie turnip, Applegate. In a forest. As if this could make any less sense."

    ash "Well, it’s a constant. And it’s visually striking."

    sib "Oh no no no no! Don’t you start now, Applegate. It’s a goddamn turnip. It’s not a power turnip."

    ash "There’s no such thing as a power turnip. Now you’re just putting words in my mouth."

    sib "I am not! Look, I know you’re concerned with the ‘good vibes’ or whatever, but this place is fertile, incredibly fertile, and if we can figure out why, we stand a good chance at manufacturing the how. There are bees in this forest, Ashley! Real bees! We have to report this back to Professor Mördorj! With live specimens, he could-"

    ash "-Probably figure out some way to make his replacements better? Thanks, but no thanks. I’d prefer to save the patient, not harvest it for parts."

    sib "What...?! How does—the fuck are you even talking about? What’s your plan here, Ashley? How is leaving this unreported helping anyone?"

    ash "I can figure out a way to expand it! We’re taking a risk just being here, Sibyl. These kinds of places are extremely delicate. It won’t survive that kind of rigorous observation, and then we’ll lose the only place in America, maybe even the world, where there have been confirmed wild honeybee sightings." 

    ash "This could be our last shot, and you want to do to it the exact same thing countless others have tried—and failed— to do on other, similar spots? Don’t be absurd. This place needs to be preserved."

    sib "I can’t believe I’m even having this discussion. You’re saying that science is killing bees, and we have to keep it away from here? Do you realize how crazy you sound right now?"

    "She shakes her head sadly."

    sib "No. No, we’re going to bring in the Professor, and he’s going to learn something from this. Hell if I know what, but it’s more than I can say about you."

    ash "Absolutely not."

    "Sibyl’s face sets in what I can already recognize as the beginnings of genuine anger; once that happens, discussion is a lost cause, so I decide to compromise."

    ash "...Give me a chance. Let me look at it first, just for a day or two, and see if I can’t figure out some way to... immunize it to whatever you plan on doing. Shift the focal point somewhere else, I don’t know. Two days, and you can call it in."

    "It’s a tense moment as Sibyl debates the offer, my heart hammering in my chest. The fate of the world might well rest with this decision."

    sib "...Fine."

    sib "Two days. But after that, we’re figuring out why there’s a blue prairie turnip in a forest, and I’d better not hear you bleating about crystal healing or some shit. Got it?"

    ash "Got it."

    nar "It’s certainly a turnip flower."

    nar "Measuring the diameter of the clearing, it’s obvious that this flower is focal center of the forest, which makes it the key piece of this whole ecosystem. That, in and of itself, is strange. Flowers aren’t known for their permanence, and they lack the physical fortitude of the tree. Despite my earlier statements, there’s no telling what all that energy might have done to this flower to have turned it such a vivid blue, or what removing it might do. One thing is certain, though; if anyone were foolish enough to do that, the natural damage would be calculated in lives."

    nar "And there are about three thousand damned fools on the other end of Sibyl’s phone. I have to figure out a way to either prevent that from happening or child-proof this spot. For her own part, Sibyl has settled for analysing whatever she can get her hands on in a futile attempt to discern why this clearing is unique."

    nar "It’s an immensely empowering victory, but the feeling of vertigo dissipates as quickly as it arrived. Sibyl’s retreated, however briefly, to the recesses of her home-base. She’s sure to be back soon, however, and with the tools needed to extract whatever she can from this natural respite"

    nar "I’m intimately familiar with her methods. It will begin with perhaps the most minute of physical samples - a leaf, or a petal. But her curiosity won’t be sated just inflicting a few surface wounds; eventually, she’ll come to harvest the entire plant, bringing it back into a controlled environment, and dissect it centimeter by centimeter until its usefulness is completely exhausted. And then it will be discarded like a cheap corner-store bottle of two-dollar booze."

    nar "She isn’t a bad person—she’s one of the most idealistic people I know, if in a warped way. She truly wants to help people, to save people—but this isn't the way. Her actions will disrupt the flow of energy that passes through this small meadow, and if there are answers to find, I’m only going to find them here. It is, of course, my duty to find the truth."

    nar "I fish around in my backpack. The only items I brought for sustenance were a canteen of water, along with some bottles, and my favourite kind of trail mix: Smarties, peanuts, chocolate chips and pretzels. I make a mean gorp."

Let’s consider my options: I could forage locally, but back in the scouts I always seemed to converge upon the incredibly toxic plants.

    flo "There's no need for protection in here, Ash. So distant your bloodline, so lost the sap of the rowan-tree in you. Oak, ash and thorn, but you're only one of three. And she is a Cassandra, of bleakest prophecy."

    "I'm so tired. Something else makes me want to sleep, just a few more hours. Just a few..."

    "I sit up straight, hitting my head on... nothing. I'm not in the tent at all. I'm outside the tent, which I've bound to the ground facing the cardinal directions, its sealed entrance facing south. Is it morning yet? No. It's cold. What am I doing outside?"

    "I unseal the tent, crawl back in, and try for a few more hours of sleep. On a sudden impulse, I briefly flash my maglite on. The flower's still there. It looks beautiful, and yet baleful; it looks sad, and yet hopeful. It's the last thought I have before I fall back into slumber."

    ash "..."

    flo "There aren't many true blue flowers. And of those which are, many are air-headed, silly things. Some are purple, and inclined to melancholy and regret; some are spiteful, and depressed when not. There are very few of us indeed. And now, only one."

    flo "I'm old.  Amongst oak and thorn, I remain alive, but that is all. Living is sometimes not the same as life."

    "I'm dreaming again, I must be. The blue light is all around me, calm and peaceful, and just a little sad now, maybe a little more hopeful. That's not reasonable. It's not logical that a colour should have moods, right? That's what Sibyl would say. But I think I'm beginning to understand."

    "This is the colour of need that sees the possibility of fulfilment; this is what it looks like to find love when you've learnt to forget it exists."

    flo "Do you love bees?"

Their pleasant hum, their gold-glinting fur in the bright sun, and the dark chitinous bands that seem to hold their radiance together like a present made for a goddess... 'melissa', the Greeks would have said, 'melissa' — sweet, comfortable, the sound of summer."

    ash "Bees are very me."

    ash "They have dances and patterns and they don't always seem tied down by reason and logic."

    "There's a smile in my head — a pale blue smile."

    flo "... and sometimes, seeds."

    ash "Seeds?"

    "Yes, I think, seeds! Where are the seeds?"

    flo "There'll be no more of us, the way things are. We will be one with dry lake and dead star. When you wake in the day, think of my need. Think of the last flower, and the last..."
