    "I let out a sigh of relief I wasn't fully aware was there. It'd be easy to spend the rest of the day keeping an eye on it. I have enough of an idea of what to expect; I'd have to be ready."

    "Regardless, I have time to kill before Sibyl finds her way back. At least, that's what I think. I reach into my tent blindly, searching for that book I was halfway through while keeping a lookout for my cold-blooded plant-murdering partner. My hand chases a few tactile ghosts before it manages to snag the real thing."

    ash "Ah, there it is."

    "The Power of Flow: Practical Ways to Transform Your Life with Meaningful Coincidence. I've been meaning to find my flow for a while now. For a moment my brain rearranges the words to read The Flower of Power before the letters fall back into shape. I position myself cross-legged, and crack the book open to where I left off."

    sib "...You have got to be kidding."

    "One of my eyebrows perks up. Pity, I'd thought I had more time to myself."

    sib "You didn't spend the entire night out here, did you?"

    ash "You catch on quickly."

    "I glance up to get a look at her, favouring her with the shadow of a smirk. She's certainly come equipped to dig up a plant, short of a combine harvester. She's brought a moderately-sized plastic capsule—like an oversized medicinal pill—as well as a small shovel. The top of her head is crowned with a straw sunhat; it's slightly lopsided, partially covering her eyes. What can still be seen reflects total exasperation with the entire situation."

    ash "Cute hat." 

    sib "Tsk...!"

    sib "...Not particularly." 

    "She mutters, shaking her head and rising to her feet." 

    sib "What the hell's the meaning of this?"

    ash "I should ask you the same thing. Remember what we agreed to last night? You said you'd give me two days to examine the plant in its natural environment."

    "She bites her lower lip, stirring uncomfortably. I glance up, darting her an inquisitive look of my own." 

    ash "Well?"

    sib "Just one plucked petal wouldn't have killed it..." 

    "She looks guiltily back."

    sib "H-hey, what about you!? What were you doing here all night?"

    sib "Pfft, as if."

    sib "Yes. Your ability to count is still on point."

    ash "Sibyl, there are two of them on the flower. Like, right now."

    sib "S-say what?"

    "She scampers over to my side, kneeling down carefully to get a better look. Her eyes widen for a moment, but she holds her breath. Neither of us makes any further sound as we watch enrapt."

    sib "Well I'll be stuffed, Ash! You think there might be a colony somewhere?"

    ash "I'd imagine so. Do you want to take a look around on foot and see?"

    "She shoots me a look."

    sib "Since when do I have to do all the footwork here?"

    ash "I'm on sentry duty here. If I let my eyes wander, there'd be nothing between you and a count of abduction."

    sib "Plants don't have rights, y'know... but fine, fine, I get it. I'll take a look around. Enjoy your alone time with the plant."

    nar "There's a lingering thought in the back of my head. The phenomenon of the multiplying bees reminds me of that dream from last night. Usually dreams are so spotty, inconsistent, cryptic, flippant and altogether pretty frivolous. They leave as quickly as they come, gone before you can understand its intricacies, its meaning. Like a snowflake melting in the palm of your hand, it eludes the grasp of critical thought in an instant."

    nvl clear

    nar "And yet I remember the details of this dream perfectly, as foggy as they are. It's difficult to recall the shapes, to imagine any physical forms. But I can't convince myself it wasn't real; part of it feels like it's taken root in the recesses of my imagination, somehow."

    nvl clear

    nar "I sit there, wondering about the meaning of it all. Blue fairies, blue turnips, and these elusive seeds. Were the seeds the key to solving this crisis?"

    ash "...It's impossible to say for sure."

    "A familiar sarcastic voice drones from across the meadow."

    ash "That was a pretty quick survey. By the look on your face, you didn't have much luck either."

    sib "No sirree... that'd be too easy, wouldn't it?"

    "Sibyl sulks, looking visibly deflated. She raises her head, along with an eyebrow, and casually points her shovel in my direction."

    sib "You didn't answer my question. You figure anything out about it yet?"

    "I pause, considering the information I knew. With girls like Sibyl, you have to keep your cards close to your chest. On the other hand, we definitely have an understanding between one another. Still, I highly doubt she'll believe the body of information I collected. And it might spur her on to do something regrettable."

    ash "This flower is a rare specimen... the last of its kind, perhaps. You see how it's flowering? It must be near the end of its life, but it continues to live and breathe life. The bees are drawn to this flower, but..."

    "I pause for a moment, wincing to try and recollect those gentle, albeit cryptic words the voice in my dream had shared with me. I barely notice Sibyl's expression drawing more and more curious."

    sib "Wait, this thing's the last of its kind? You figured that out? I mean, I thought it was just some radiation or soil-induced blue mutation."

    "Her grip on her tool tightens."

    sib "Well, if we just bring it to the lab, all we have to do is extract its seeds and grow some more! A hundred o' them, if we have to!"

    "I shake my head."

    ash "Something's wrong, though. Do you see any seeds on this plant? It won't be that easy."

    "She takes a second look, eyes widening to confirm. It's a worrying thought, to be sure. I continue."

    ash "We haven't seen a flower like this one. It may not have completed its germination cycle even in its old age. If we tampered with it now, we might cause its extinction. We need to give it more time."

    "I couldn't bear to uproot it and examine it to find out. She pauses to consider for a moment, before glowering."

    sib "How the hell would you know it was truly one of a kind? We both figured it was just some off-coloured turnip flower just yesterday and now you're flip-flopping. I got the same certifications you did." 

    "She folds her arms."

    sib "I bet the colors of the wind told you something, or some dumb hoo-hah like that."

    "I blink forcefully, glancing to the flower. Sibyl catches this moment of weakness, glancing between the plant and I, and opens her mouth to say something."

    ash "You... you aren't wrong per se, Sibyl..."

    "A sound escapes her mouth that was halfway between a dying animal and a deflating balloon. She rolls her eyes so hard I almost lose sight of her irises."

    sib "You've got to be kidding, Ash..."

    ash "It came to me in a dream. Like a... a blue fairy."

    "One of her eyebrows rises like it had bounded off a trampoline."

    sib "Fairies? Can't say I found any of those out on my survey. Considering they don't exist, Ash."

    "Her words cut, but something stirred inside of me, looking at the plant. The voice from the dream. It was something I could hear, but not see. And this, in the physical world..."

    "Was the voice in the dream, and this flower I'd set myself out to protect... they couldn't be..."

    sib "You, uh, didn't hit your head too hard against the dirt, right? It was probably just a dumb dream."

    "Sibyl leans closer to get a better look at me."

    ash "...I need a moment alone, if you don't mind."

    sib "What the hell...? I can't stick around to observe?"

    ash "I'll be fine, just need to think about something."

    "She grinds her teeth for a moment."

    sib "Whatever. I got a good enough look at it for now. Not gonna be of much help until I can get it in a lab anyway." 

    "She glowers, starting to pace away. Suddenly, she stops to look back to me."

    sib "Call me up on the talkie if you need something. You look like shit. Not sure if you're sick in the head or, whatever, just... don't overextend yourself, or anything. We're partners, yeah?"

    "Worry in her tone creaks out through a facade of indifference."

    ash "Yeah. Sure."

    I take a look at the curious flower. I remember that if you talk to plants, it would help them grow. That snippet of folk wisdom probably existed for the faculties of lonely housewives for centuries, but... today, here, there's something more to it, I'm sure."

    "I gesture in Sibyl's direction."

    ash "Don't worry about her. That's Sibyl, she's just... doing her job, I guess."

    "I don't get a response. Of course. Something inside me spurs me on to keep talking."

    ash "That was you in the dream, wasn't it? The last of your kind? I have to say, you have an odd way of speaking. It's... rather... flowery..."

    "I cough, chastising myself for saying such a dumb thing out loud."

    ash "Sorry, sorry, I... this is all kind of new to me. I mean, you sounded like you had a good read on how things were going, what with the environment going all... sepia-tone. Normally, turnip flowers produce seeds, but I don't see anything of the sort on you, and it's... they might be the key to fixing all this."

    "I take an uneven breath."

    ash "But the way things are going... it sounded like you want me to do something, but I'm not sure what I can do. I only have one more day until they come and take you away, and... I can stand in front of one of them, but if she gets more help, I won't slow them down. So what am I supposed to..."

    "I trail off, lowering my head to the loamy soil. My expression flattens. There's a dull chime in the back of my head. The knots in my stomach loosen as my eyelids flutter slightly."

    "I glance back to the plant. It remains upright, attentive. Part of me feels like this little ritual has a greater purpose to it. But I can't put my finger on what that purpose is quite yet."

    "Worrying like this would only wind me up tighter. Hell, I was talking to a flower, that can't be good for my psyche." 
     
    ash "Maybe I'll take a quick breather to clear my head a bit..."

    "I crawl into the tent, remember that the voice would only come speak to me in dreams. To sleep, perchance to dream, as it were. My best ideas always came to me after a burst of inspiration, not agonizing over the details. Perhaps this was the inspiration I needed."
