    sib "Hey, I was watching that!"

    "She protested from the chair"

    ash "And I wasn't.  We're here to save the bees, not postulate how best to replace them.  I might also remind you that we're on the clock."

    sib "Oh? And since when has that concerned you, huh? Last time I checked, you were spending all your time researching ‘power stones’ and ‘mystery spots’."

    ash "Such disdain from my esteemed colleague. I’ll have you know that most mystery spots are glorified side show attractions, and power stones are a sham."

    sib "Then why are we looking for them?"

    ash "We’re not. What we’re doing is far more legitimate. Or have you forgotten about the time I singlehandedly saved the lower Southwest from famine?"

    sib "You raked some yards, while actual scientists introduced a new strain of genetically modified corn into circulation."

    ash "Corn which had yet to be harvested when the survey reported increased yield in the ballpark of 200 percent. Those yards were interrupting the flow of natural energy to the crops. How many times do I have to explain this?"

    sib "I don’t know! Until it makes sense? There’s no such thing as ‘ley lines’, or ‘spiritual energy’! The only reason you’re even on board with this project is complete luck! Your thesis was on, what, feng shui?"

    "She points toward the muted screen, where a silent Professor Mördorj presumably continues his rant about human superiority."

    sib "That’s a real scientist! Professor Mördorj is right! Bees are gone; we’re just here to confirm the time of death! It’s not that big a deal."

    "I sigh heavily, partly for the theatrics of it, partly to annoy her, but mostly due to genuine concern."

    ash "They aren’t. We’re not. And it is."

    "Sibyl settles for a glower, both of us having reached the end of our umpteeth meaningless debate."

    nar "\n\n\n\nI was never one to make friends easily—I’m a scientist, my name’s Ashley Applegate—and I always made even fewer friends among my peers. There’s a hard truth I’ve learned over the years I’ve spent saving the planet; scientists are sheep, same as the rest. A generation of knowledge that exists only to persecute those rare few who dare to preach the controversy. Luck, they call it. Coincidence. But I know the truth. Nature relies on systems that can never be quantified, analysed, dissected into parts to be viewed on glass slides."

    nar "They need me here because when the chips are down, when the apocalypse looms overhead like the Sword of Damocles, they can’t afford to discount the hard evidence I provide. My system works, unlike theirs, and now that their backs are to the wall, they’re desperate enough to admit it. Lucky for them, I don’t hold grudges."

    ash "...Like the Ghostbusters, actually."

    sib "What was that?"

    ash "I said I’ve found something. Take a look at this map."

    "Sibyl reluctantly makes her way over, a sandwich still in hand."

    sib "You’re circled some trees, I see."

    ash "How very observant. But we’re talking about the bigger picture. This entire area’s full of low level foliage. Shrubs, relatively young trees, common plants for a common place."

    ash "But this, this spot here, is denser by an order of magnitude. Trees that double the height of any in the surrounding area. Growth like that takes time, Sibyl. This forest has been around for centuries, and why?"

    "I glance up at her, only to get a blank stare in response."

    sib "Uh, because no one chopped it down? Why, what crazed reason have you latched on to today?"

    ash "Because,” I say through almost gritted teeth, “it is a focal point. Bigger than any I’ve seen. Hyper-fertile land, fed by a veritable fountain of natural energy! I’m betting the farms around here are incredibly lucrative."

    sib "Oh boy, here we go."

    ash "Finally, we agree on something. Pack your bags, Sibyl. We’ve got a forest to align."

    sib "A forest to what?"

    ash "Rake some yards! Now, pack. Your. Bags."

    sib "I swear to God, if I end up contracting malaria because of you, I’ll sue you."

    ash "For?"

    sib "You took my goddamn mosquito repellant! While I slept!"

    ash "You obviously would have objected had you been awake."

    sib "Obviously!"

    ash "Look, I can’t risk you contaminating the focal point. It won’t be needed anyway—this area won’t have any mosquitoes."

    sib "It’s the middle of August. Everywhere has mosquitoes."

    "I shrug, allowing the complete lack of mosquitoes to make the point."

    sib "...so what are you expecting we’ll find out here again?"

    ash "Areas like this are always circular, and they’re usually centered around something of significant natural importance. Usually a rock, or a tree. Something constant and physically striking."

    sib "I thought you said power stones are a sham?"

    ash "Once you remove a rock from its focal point, it’s just a rock. It’s only a symbol of something much greater, but symbols have power, and this power can be manipulated."

    ash "I’m hoping that if we improve the condition of the area, we can expand it. Turn this fertile county into a fertile state. We’re talking about enough produce to feed thousands of people."

    "Sibyl wipes the sweat from her forehead in a frustrated gesture."

    sib "Yeah, great. Let’s clean up some litter to fight global famine. This is what I signed up for. Trudging through a forest in the middle of bumfuck Mississippi, for days, to look at a rock, in the hopes that we can transform a natural ecosystem into a zen-fucking-garden that produces food."

    sib "For God’s sake, Ashley, can we just admit, for a day, that this is completely-"

    ash "A bee."

    sib "What do you mean—a bee!"

    "As casually as a dog in a park, a bee flies from flower to flower, a fuzzy, buzzing lump. It's the first confirmed bee sighting in over a year."

    sib "What do we do?!" # Sibyl breathes.

    ash "Isn’t that obvious? We follow it. The center must be close."

    "Sibyl swallows and nods. Struck momentarily silent by the sight of what’s nowadays the insect counterpart of Bigfoot, she seems to forget her exhaustion."

    "The bee doesn’t seem to be nearly as impressed, and continues its rounds, leaving us to carefully trail it from a safe distance like a pair of detectives."

    sib "Yes, but what’s it doing here?"

    ash "You’re the scientist, you tell me."

    sib "Oh, don’t even act like you knew there were bees here! If I had to guess, which I do, I’d say we’re far enough away from civilization that whatever is killing the bees doesn’t reach here."

    ash "Doesn’t explain why African bees are dying. Or European bees. Or Australian bees. Or-"

    sib "Why do I even bother talking to you?"

    ash "Because you know, deep down, that I’m right! What’s killing the bees has nothing to do with industry and everything to do with the mindset behind it. The signs are everywhere. Global warming, the Tunguska Event, Colony Collapse Disorder..."

    sib "...The Bermuda Triangle? Roswell? Area 51?"

    ash "This isn’t tinfoil hat stuff, Sibyl! This is reality. Science—the modern institution of science—refuses to accept the fact that nature is far more complex, far more enigmatic than they want you to believe."

    "Sibyl sighs and sets down her pack, giving me the tired stare of a dogged teenage babysitter."

    sib "Applegate, it’s clear you’re dying to elucidate on your crazy hobo theory, so just get it over with."

    ash "We’re moving further away from nature. Our buildings are synthetic, our vehicles are synthetic, our food is becoming synthetic, and now even our bees are synthetic. Why does everyone think these things wouldn’t have consequences?"

    sib "Because humanity isn’t the cornerstone of nature. We’re not special, Ashley. Bees aren’t special. They’re just insects."

    ash "Every time you say that, a bee dies."

    sib "...Please tell me you’re joking."

    ash "Look forward to my next dissertation."
